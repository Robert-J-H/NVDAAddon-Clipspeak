1. For editing facilities: Is there a way to check for select all/undo/redo capabilities?
2. For clipboard facilities:
A. Check the control being acted on. No message should be spoken on the taskbar, for instance.
B. Check the clipboard data itself and speak an appropriate message.
C. Unusual windows (sound editors, midi sequencers etc), we could check menu items, but sometimes copy operations are built into the keyboard accelerators rather than menus.
